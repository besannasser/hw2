         <p>They say, oh my god, I see the way you shine
            Take your hands, my dear, and place them both in mine
            You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
            And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
            Ooh, I see you, see you, see you every time
            And oh my, I, I, I like your style
            You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
            And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
            So they say
            Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh
            I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
            They say
            Move for me, move me, move for me, ayy-ayy
            And when you're done I'll make you do it all again
            I said, oh my god, I see you walking by
            Take my hands, my dear, and look me in my eyes
            Just like a monkey, I've been dancin' my whole life
            But you just beg to see me dance just one more time
            Ooh, I see you, see you, see you every time
            And oh my, I, I, I like your style
            You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
            And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
            So they say
            Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh
            I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
            They say
            Move for me, move for me, move for me, ayy-ayy
            And when you're done I'll make you do it all again
            They say
            Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh
            I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
